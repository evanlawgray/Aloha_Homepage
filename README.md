/* Using HTML and CSS

Certain elements on the page use flexbox, as I learned it in the part-time web dev program and got accustomed to it. There is a float on the two footer content divs though. I hope that's ok. I mentioned it to a couple of the other instructors and they seemed cool with me using it for this project.

I feel like there is still some inelegant, hacky css in here, and I just realized that I forgot to set the base font-size to 16px past the tablet breakpoint, but I really need to go to sleep, so this will have to do for now.

The biggest things that I have improved on through this project is my understanding of the box model and the proper use of margin/padding to organize and lay out content and the importance of using consistent layouts and unit sizes. I'll have to go through this ome more to improve on the above. */
